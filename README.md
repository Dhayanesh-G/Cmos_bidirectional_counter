# Overview of CMOS Bidirectional Counter IP
    
  This project presents the implementation of a CMOS-based bidirectional counter, a crucial component in digital electronics for applications requiring counting in both increasing and decreasing 
directions. By leveraging complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology, the design achieves low power consumption and high noise immunity, making it suitable for portable and battery-operated devices. 
The bidirectional counter operates by utilizing control signals to determine the counting direction, 
enhancing flexibility in digital systems. Key advantages include reduced chip area, improved speed due to parallel processing capabilities, and robustness against 
temperature variations. The project highlights the potential of CMOS technology in advancing digital 
counting mechanisms.
